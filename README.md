![am-i-responsive-image](documentation/readme-images/am-i-responsive")

# Introduction

The platform was built utilizing Django, boasting comprehensive CRUD operations and an intuitive user interface to facilitate volunteering for agape-related tasks. Users receive alerts in the form of notification boxes for any updates to their accounts or bookings. Administrators enjoy additional privileges, such as the ability to search for volunteers and their selected tasks based on dates and usernames.

# Key Project Goals

The goals of the sites functionality are:

- List View: users will get introduced about agape and can view the tasks they can volunteer
- Register: users can register to the site so that they can use the sites functionality

# Agile Development

A Kaban board was used in GitHub to create the agile development process â€“ see the board [here]( https://github.com/users/sarahgoodwin93/projects/3 "Kaban board for Wild Swim Scotland Project")

User stories were labelled using the MoSCoW method.

# User Experience

## Wireframes

![HomePage](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "Lucid image")
![SignIn ](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "Lucid image")
![SignUp ](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "Lucid image")
![VolunteerForm Page](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "Lucid image")
![Volunteer Home ](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "Lucid image")
![Volunteer Home Admin](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "Lucid image")
![Volunteer Detail](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "Lucid image")
![Profile](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "Lucid image")

Site structure was created before the site was created to test layout idea.

## Database Schema

The project uses ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL relational database for storing the data.

The data schema was created using [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com "Lucid Chart") before the project was started to get the flow and function of the models. 

![Data Schema Image](documentation/readme-images/new-data-schema.png " Data Schema Image ")

## Typography

The google font [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins "Poppins") was used throughout the site with different weights for different headings and paragraphs.

I selected this font due to its tall stature and expansive proportions, which enhance readability.

## Colour Palette

- The main colors used were based on the the colors in the logo.
  - #f9f8f1 
  - #f5f5dc
  - #491609
  - #491609
  - #000000
  
![Color palette Image](documentation/readme-images/colour-palette.png "Color palette Image ")

### Logo

The logo used in the head section is agape community's official logo. Permission was taken to use the logo

![Logo Image](documentation/readme-images/ws-logo.png " Logo Image ")

## Design Choices

I aimed for the website's design to convey a sense of warmth and hospitality to visitors. My goal was to ensure that navigating the site would be effortless and intuitive, providing users with easy access to the information they seek. Rather than overwhelming visitors with excessive details about Agape, I focused on presenting essential information in a clear and concise manner. Through strategic decisions, I endeavored to introduce Agape in a manner that would resonate positively with users.
